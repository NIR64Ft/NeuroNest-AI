# NeuroNest-AI Architecture

## Overview

NeuroNest-AI is a multi-purpose intelligent agent platform that transforms ideas into functional projects. The platform uses specialized AI agents to understand user requirements, generate code, and produce executable projects.

## Core Components

### 1. Frontend Interface
- Interactive chat interface
- Multi-modal input support (text, voice, files)
- Real-time output display
- Project preview capabilities

### 2. Agent System
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates between agents, manages workflow
- **Thinking Agent**: Analyzes requests, creates execution plans
- **Developer Agent**: Generates code based on specifications
  - Frontend Developer: HTML, CSS, JS
  - Backend Developer: Server-side code, APIs
  - Mobile Developer: Android/iOS applications
- **Editor Agent**: Reviews, refines, and improves outputs
- **Execution Agent**: Manages project building, dependency installation, and execution

### 3. Project Management
- Project structure generation
- Dependency management
- Version control integration
- Cloud storage for projects

### 4. Execution Environment
- Containerized execution (Docker)
- Live preview server
- Multi-language runtime support
- Secure sandbox for code execution

### 5. API Integrations
- AI model APIs (Gemini, etc.)
- Speech-to-text services
- Cloud storage services
- Version control systems

## Data Flow

1. User inputs request (text, voice, or file)
2. Orchestrator analyzes request and activates appropriate agents
3. Thinking Agent breaks down request into actionable steps
4. Developer Agent(s) generate code based on the plan
5. Editor Agent reviews and refines the output
6. Execution Agent prepares the environment and runs the code
7. Results are displayed to the user through the frontend interface

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- React.js with Next.js
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Socket.io for real-time communication

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- Python for AI agent processing
- Docker for containerization
- MongoDB for data storage

### AI Integration
- Gemini API for agent intelligence
- Custom prompt engineering for specialized agents
- Vector database for context management

## Security Considerations

- Sandboxed execution environment
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and usage quotas
- Secure API key management
